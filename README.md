This is an xtend version of the sample app developed within this excellent text:

- [Learning Andorid, 2nd Edition, Gargenta, Nakamura](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023456.do)

The code for that text is also on github, across a number of repositories, here:

- <https://github.com/learning-android>

The features more or less correspond with the final version of the app (except for Widget support). The class names have been retained, although the package structure has been adjusted.
